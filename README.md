In this work, we use the DNNBrain Python toolbox to study popular convolutional neural networks (AlexNet) and how they distinguish images. We extend the analysis to colors to further analyse how colors might be percieved by a CNN. Finally, we design a color classifier using two methods and show that a model originally trained to classify images can classify blocks of colors. This is unintutive because CNNs work on the principles of detecting edges and corners which should only lead to classification based on salient parts of the images.
